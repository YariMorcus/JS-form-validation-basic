# JS form validation basic project

![](screenshot.png)

The goal of this project was to introduce myself to basic JavaScript form validation.
All code has been written myself but I did follow along with the article.
Bear in mind that this was not a challenge in which I had to come up with my solution.

This project was purely for educational purposes to prepare myself for the [Newsletter sign-up form with success message](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv) challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
